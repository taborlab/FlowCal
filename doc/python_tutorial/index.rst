FlowCal's Python API Tutorial
=============================

``FlowCal`` is, at its core, a Python library that a programmer can use to analyze flow cytometry data in a more flexible way than with the :doc:`Excel UI</excel_ui/index>`. This section gives an overview of the abilities of ``FlowCal`` from a programmer's perspective. The tutorials below are listed below in order of increasing complexity. We recommend the reader to go through them in order.

.. note:: The ``FlowCal`` Python API tutorial assumes that the reader is familiar with Python, ``numpy`` and ``matplotlib``. It also assumes that the reader has Python 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, or 3.8 installed, as well as ``FlowCal`` and all its dependencies. For more information on installation, refer to the :doc:`Getting started</getting_started/index>` section.
