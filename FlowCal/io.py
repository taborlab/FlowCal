    Read TEXT segment of FCS file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    buf : file-like object

    delim : str, optional
        1-byte delimiter character which delimits key-value entries of
        TEXT segment. If None and ``supplemental==False``, will extract
        delimiter as first byte of TEXT segment.
    supplemental : bool, optional
        Flag specifying that segment is a supplemental TEXT segment (see
        FCS3.0 and FCS3.1), in which case a delimiter (``delim``) must be
        specified.

    Returns
    -------
    text : dict
        Dictionary of key-value entries extracted from TEXT segment.
    delim : str or None
        String containing delimiter or None if TEXT segment is empty.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If supplemental TEXT segment (``supplemental==True``) but ``delim`` is
        not specified.
    ValueError
        If primary TEXT segment (``supplemental==False``) does not start with
        delimiter.
    ValueError
        If first keyword starts with delimiter (e.g. a primary TEXT segment
        with the following contents: ///k1/v1/k2/v2/).
    ValueError
        If odd number of keys + values detected (indicating an unpaired key or
        value).
    ValueError
        If TEXT segment is ill-formed (unable to be parsed according to the
        FCS standards).

    Notes
    -----
    ANALYSIS segments and supplemental TEXT segments are parsed the same way,
    so this function can also be used to parse ANALYSIS segments.

    This function does *not* automatically parse and accumulate additional
    TEXT-like segments (e.g. supplemental TEXT segments or ANALYSIS segments)
    referenced in the originally specified TEXT segment.

    Read DATA segment of FCS file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    buf : file-like object
        Buffer containing data to interpret as DATA segment.
    begin : int
        Offset (in bytes) to first byte of DATA segment in `buf`.
    end : int
        Offset (in bytes) to last byte of DATA segment in `buf`.
    datatype : {'I', 'F', 'D', 'A'}
        String specifying FCS file datatype (see $DATATYPE keyword from
        FCS standards). Supported datatypes include 'I' (unsigned
        binary integer), 'F' (single precision floating point), and 'D'
        (double precision floating point). 'A' (ASCII) is recognized
        but not supported.
    num_events : int
        Total number of events (see $TOT keyword from FCS standards).
    param_bit_widths : array-like
        Array specifying parameter (aka channel) bit width for each
        parameter (see $PnB keywords from FCS standards). The length of
        `param_bit_widths` should match the $PAR keyword value from the
        FCS standards (which indicates the total number of parameters).
        If `datatype` is 'I', data must be byte aligned (i.e. all
        parameter bit widths should be divisible by 8), and data are
        upcast to the nearest uint8, uint16, uint32, or uint64 data
        type. Bit widths larger than 64 bits are not supported.
    big_endian : bool
        Endianness of computer used to acquire data (see $BYTEORD
        keyword from FCS standards). True implies big endian; False
        implies little endian.
    param_ranges : array-like, optional
        Array specifying parameter (aka channel) range for each
        parameter (see $PnR keywords from FCS standards). Used to
        ensure erroneous values are not read from DATA segment by
        applying a bit mask to remove unused bits. The length of
        `param_ranges` should match the $PAR keyword value from the FCS
        standards (which indicates the total number of parameters). If
        None, no masking is performed.

    Returns
    -------
    data : numpy array
        NxD numpy array describing N cytometry events observing D data
        dimensions.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If lengths of `param_bit_widths` and `param_ranges` don't match.
    ValueError
        If calculated DATA segment size (as determined from the number
        of events, the number of parameters, and the number of bytes per
        data point) does not match size specified by `begin` and `end`.
    ValueError
        If `param_bit_widths` doesn't agree with `datatype` for single
        precision or double precision floating point (i.e. they should
        all be 32 or 64, respectively).
    ValueError
        If `datatype` is unrecognized.
    NotImplementedError
        If `datatype` is 'A'.
    NotImplementedError
        If `datatype` is 'I' but data is not byte aligned.

class FCSFile(object):
    """
    Class representing an FCS flow cytometry data file.

    This class parses a binary FCS file and exposes a read-only view
    of the HEADER, TEXT, DATA, and ANALYSIS segments via Python-friendly
    data structures.

    Parameters
    ----------
    infile : str or file-like
        Reference to the associated FCS file.

    Attributes
    ----------
    infile : str or file-like
        Reference to associated FCS file.
    header : namedtuple
        Version information and byte offset values of other FCS segments
        in the following order:
            - version : str
            - text_begin : int
            - text_end : int
            - data_begin : int
            - data_end : int
            - analysis_begin : int
            - analysis_end : int
    text : dict
        Dictionary of keyword-value entries from TEXT segment and optional
        supplemental TEXT segment.
    data : numpy array
        Unwriteable NxD numpy array describing N cytometry events
        observing D data dimensions.
    analysis : dict
        Dictionary of keyword-value entries from ANALYSIS segment.

    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If $MODE is not 'L'.
    NotImplementedError
        If $DATATYPE is not 'I', 'F', or 'D'.
    NotImplementedError
        If $DATATYPE is 'I' but data is not byte aligned.
    NotImplementedError
        If $BYTEORD is not big endian ('4,3,2,1' or '2,1') or little
        endian ('1,2,3,4', '1,2').
    ValueError
        If primary TEXT segment does not start with delimiter.
    ValueError
        If TEXT-like segment has odd number of total extracted keys and
        values (indicating an unpaired key or value).
    ValueError
        If calculated DATA segment size (as determined from the number
        of events, the number of parameters, and the number of bytes per
        data point) does not match size specified in HEADER segment
        offsets.
    Warning
        If more than one data set is detected in the same file.
    Warning
        If the ANALYSIS segment was not successfully parsed.

    Notes
    -----
    The Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) describes the de facto standard
    file format used by flow cytometry acquisition and analysis software
    to record flow cytometry data to and load flow cytometry data from a
    file. The standard dictates that each file must have the following
    segments: HEADER, TEXT, and DATA. The HEADER segment contains
    version information and byte offset values of other segments, the
    TEXT segment contains delimited key-value pairs containing
    acquisition information, and the DATA segment contains the recorded
    flow cytometry data. The file may optionally have an ANALYSIS
    segment (structurally identicaly to the TEXT segment), a
    supplemental TEXT segment (according to more recent versions of the
    standard), and user-defined OTHER segments.

    This class supports a subset of the FCS3.1 standard which should be
    backwards compatible with FCS3.0 and FCS2.0. The FCS file must be
    of the following form:
        - $MODE = 'L' (list mode; histogram mode is not supported).
        - $DATATYPE = 'I' (unsigned binary integers), 'F' (single
          precision floating point), or 'D' (double precision floating
          point). 'A' (ASCII) is not supported.
        - If $DATATYPE = 'I', $PnB % 8 = 0 (byte aligned) for all
          parameters (aka channels).
        - $BYTEORD = '4,3,2,1' (big endian) or '1,2,3,4' (little
          endian).
        - One data set per file.

    For more information on the TEXT segment keywords (e.g. $MODE,
    $DATATYPE, etc.), see [1]_, [2]_, and [3]_.

    Object containing events data from a flow cytometry sample.

    An `FCSData` object is an NxD numpy array representing N cytometry
    events with D dimensions (channels) extracted from the DATA segment of
    an FCS file. Indexing along the second axis can be performed by channel
    name, which allows to easily select data from one or several channels.
    Otherwise, an `FCSData` object can be treated as a numpy array for most
    purposes.

    Information regarding the acquisition date, time, and information about
    the detector and the amplifiers are parsed from the TEXT segment of the
    FCS file and exposed as attributes. The TEXT and ANALYSIS segments are
    also exposed as attributes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    infile : str or file-like
        Reference to the associated FCS file.

    Attributes
    ----------
    infile : str or file-like
        Reference to associated FCS file.
    text : dict
        Dictionary of keyword-value entries from TEXT segment of the FCS
        file.
    analysis : dict
        Dictionary of keyword-value entries from ANALYSIS segment of the
        FCS file.
    data_type : str
        Type of data in the FCS file's DATA segment.
    time_step : float
        Time step of the time channel.
    acquisition_start_time : time or datetime
        Acquisition start time.
    acquisition_end_time : time or datetime
        Acquisition end time.
    acquisition_time : float
        Acquisition time, in seconds.
    channels : tuple
        The name of the channels contained in `FCSData`.

    Methods
    -------
    amplification_type
        Get the amplification type used for the specified channel(s).
    detector_voltage
        Get the detector voltage used for the specified channel(s).
    amplifier_gain
        Get the amplifier gain used for the specified channel(s).
    channel_labels
        Get the label of the specified channel(s).
    range
        Get the range of the specified channel(s).
    resolution
        Get the resolution of the specified channel(s).
    hist_bins
        Get histogram bin edges for the specified channel(s).

    Notes
    -----
    `FCSData` uses `FCSFile` to parse an FCS file. All restrictions on the
    FCS file format and the Exceptions spcecified for FCSFile also apply
    to FCSData.

    Parsing of some non-standard files is supported [4]_.

    Examples
    --------
    Load an FCS file into an FCSData object

    >>> import FlowCal
    >>> d = FlowCal.io.FCSData('test/Data001.fcs')

    Check channel names

    >>> print d.channels
    ('FSC-H', 'SSC-H', 'FL1-H', 'FL2-H', 'FL3-H', 'Time')

    Check the size of FCSData

    >>> print d.shape
    (20949, 6)

    Get the first 100 events

    >>> d_sub = d[:100]
    >>> print d_sub.shape
    (100, 6)

    Retain only fluorescence channels

    >>> d_fl = d[:, ['FL1-H', 'FL2-H', 'FL3-H']]
    >>> d_fl.channels
    ('FL1-H', 'FL2-H', 'FL3-H')

    Channel slicing can also be done with integer indices

    >>> d_fl_2 = d[:, [2, 3, 4]]
    >>> print d_fl_2.channels
    ('FL1-H', 'FL2-H', 'FL3-H')

        nbins : int or list of ints, optional
            The number of bins to calculate. If `channels` specifies a list
            of channels, `nbins` should be a list of integers. If `nbins`
            is None, use ``FCSData.resolution(channel)``.
        scale : str, optional
            Scale in which to generate bins. Can be either ``linear``,
            ``log``, or ``logicle``.
        kwargs : optional
            Keyword arguments specific to the selected bin scaling. Linear
            and logarithmic scaling do not use additional arguments.
            For logicle scaling, the following parameters can be provided:

            T : float, optional
                Maximum range of data. If not provided, use ``range[1]``.
            M : float, optional
                (Asymptotic) number of decades in scaled units. If not
                provided, calculate from the following::

                    max(4.5, 4.5 / np.log10(262144) * np.log10(T))

            W : float, optional
                Width of linear range in scaled units. If not provided,
                calculate using the following relationship::

                    W = (M - log10(T / abs(r))) / 2

                Where ``r`` is the minimum negative event. If no negative
                events are present, W is set to zero.

        Return
        ------
        array or list of arrays
            Histogram bin edges for the specified channel(s).

        Notes
        -----
        If ``range[0]`` is equal or less than zero and `scale` is  ``log``,
        the lower limit of the range is replaced with one.

        Logicle scaling uses the LogicleTransform class in the plot module.

        Call NDArray's __reduce__ and append FCSData state information. Per
        the pickle/cPickle documentation, __reduce__ should return a tuple
        between two and five elements long. The first three elements are

        -------
        init : callable
            Callable used to recreate the inital instance

        init_args : tuple
            Arguments to be passed to `init` to reconstitute the initial
            instance

        state : tuple
            Internal state data needed to fully reconstruct the instance. Data
            is passed to self.__setstate__() to reconstruct the object during
            deserialization. Contains the FCSData state information (packaged
